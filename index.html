          <h3>Objective:</h3>
          <p>
            This project is designed to test different prediction algorithms to
            determine the ideal model for predicting temperature in the
            short-term. It will use two main kinds of algorithms. The first are
            traditional statistics models. These are things like linear
            regression that will take the data and perform some computations
            with it. The second are machine learning models, which are more
            advanced models that are supposed to 'learn' based on the data.
          </p>

          <h3>What work has already been done:</h3>
          <h4>What have others said the best model is?</h4>
          <p>
            Before making my own model, I wanted to see what other people have
            done and what their results were. Two studies helped me select the
            models as well as give some insight on what they found their best
            models to be.
          </p>

            Iliyas Ibrahim Iliyas' Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning
            Models for Weather Forecasting tested linear and ridge regression,
            as well as Random Forest regression. It claimed that Random Forest
            outperformed linear and ridge regression.
          </p>

            Md Saydur Rahman’s Comparative Evaluation of Weather Forecasting
            using Machine Learning Models tested gradient boosting and random
            forest, with gradient boosting having a slight edge. I will be
            including both of these in my analysis.
          </p>

          <h4>How I hope to improve on the work others have done</h4>
          <p>
            My biggest problem with the sources I find is that they only judge
            models based on one thing: accuracy. This makes sense intuitively,
            but I think accuracy shouldn’t be the only metric for judging. I
            will also add models I think might perform well, to see if there are
            any that were missed...
